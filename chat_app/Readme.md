# Guided Learning Project: Chat System in Go and React

This guided learning project focuses on developing a chat system using Go and React. 

Website: [Chat System in Go and React](https://tutorialedge.net/projects/chat-system-in-go-and-react/)

## Overview
In this project, I utilized ReactJS, Go, JavaScript, and WebSockets to develop my skills in building real-time communication systems and full-stack web applications. The project involved creating both frontend and backend components to enable seamless communication between clients.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: I utilized ReactJS for building the frontend interface of the chat system. 

- **Go**: Go (Golang) was used for developing the backend server that handles WebSocket connections and manages communication between clients. 

- **JavaScript**: Alongside ReactJS, JavaScript was used extensively for client-side scripting and interaction. 

- **WebSockets**: WebSockets provided the underlying protocol for establishing bidirectional communication between the frontend and backend components of the chat system. They enabled real-time messaging without the need for continuous HTTP polling.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Full-Stack Development**: By working with ReactJS for the frontend and Go for the backend, I gained valuable experience in full-stack development. 

- **Real-Time Communication**: Implementing WebSockets for real-time communication enhanced my understanding of event-driven programming and asynchronous communication patterns. I learned how to handle WebSocket connections, manage message routing, and update the UI in response to incoming messages.
